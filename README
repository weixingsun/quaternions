A quick quaternion implementation for Android.

Also contains a vector implementation because reasons. A transformation matrix can be derived from a quaternion rotation and applied to a vector.

The only Android dependency in this project is adroid.util.FloatMath. A stub implementation of this class has been provided under /test so that you can run the unit tests on a normal desktop.
